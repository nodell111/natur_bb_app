# Natur Brandenburg

This mobile application was created for our mobile cartography class project at TU Dresden. <br><br>
The Natur Bradenburg mobile app is based on their interactive <a href="https://www.natur-brandenburg.de/karte/#&g=2,3,4,16,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15&k=">web</a> map for parks. The application aims to allow users to discover all the nature parks in Bradenburg using their mobile phones with a nice user interface. 
<br> <br>
Highlights:
<ul>
  <li>A beautiful landing page</li>
  <li>Interactive list with sorting and search</li>
    <li>Geolocation of user</li>
    <li>Interactive maps with parks and POI's</li>
    <li>Nice UI design</li>


</ul>


# Future Work
Future work would include functionality for park search in the map, the user to select their favorite parks and view them quickly on the favorites page, and map filters for the type of points of interest in the park map.
